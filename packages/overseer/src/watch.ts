  // gate is isPrMergeReady (exists && open && mergeable && green), applied uniformly.
  // Every downstream guard still applies: merge provenance binds the PR to the run
  // that produced it, Grok judges the diff, and production-effect merges stay held
  // for John.

  // (it is a CLI process), so work it already pushed has no owner. Anchor: run
