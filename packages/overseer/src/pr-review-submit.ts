/**
 * Governed reviewer -> GitHub review submission
 * (WO-HARNESS-OVERSEER-REVIEW-ROUTE-01, XO authorization 2026-08-17).
 *
 * The second half of the review route. `pr-review-ingest.ts` turns a verified
 * pull_request event into durable work bound to an exact head; this module
 * takes one claimed work item, runs the governed reviewer, and submits the
 * resulting verdict through the EXISTING Overseer App adapter.
 *
 * XO decision 1 (2026-08-17): a non-approving verdict MUST submit
 * REQUEST_CHANGES -- approve-only is not a reviewer. If submission fails, we
 * fail closed and record the blocker rather than silently degrading to "no
 * review", which would leave the PR indistinguishable from never-reviewed.
 *
 * The reviewer itself is injected. This module owns custody enforcement,
 * exact-head binding, verdict-to-event mapping, evidence-body construction,
 * and receipt writing -- not the review judgment.
