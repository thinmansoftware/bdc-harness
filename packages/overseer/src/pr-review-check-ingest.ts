/**
 * check_run / workflow_run completion -> automatic re-review ingestion
 * (bdc-harness #782 part 1; John's ruling 2026-09-07 "on overseer the recheck
 * should be implemented").
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES: the reviewer reviews a PR head on PUSH. When a required
 * check is RED at review time it posts CHANGES_REQUESTED naming the check. If
 * that check is later re-run IN PLACE and goes green at the SAME head, nothing
 * re-triggers the review: there is no new push, and the route subscribed only
 * to `pull_request`. The CHANGES_REQUESTED verdict then stands forever unless a
 * human sends a run_review row by hand. Observed live 2026-09-07 on #746
 * @1191a736 and #777 @5ac93b76: both needed an XO nudge, both then APPROVED.
 *
 * DELIBERATELY A SEPARATE MODULE FROM `pr-review-ingest.ts`. That module
 * handles the head-MOVED path (a new commit supersedes prior work); this one
 * handles the SAME-head path (the code did not change, the evidence did). The
 * two have different idempotency keys, different authorization questions, and
 * different bounds, and keeping them apart means neither can regress the other.
 *
 * PURE AND INJECTABLE, exactly like the pull_request ingest: every branch --
 * signature rejection, wrong event, still-running check, no authorizing
 * verdict, duplicate delivery, enqueue failure -- is testable with no network,
 * no database and no GitHub App key.
 *
 * RATE BUDGET: the per-user GitHub budget is shared across the whole harness
 * (it is what exhausted during #776's review). This path therefore performs NO
 * GitHub API reads at all. Every fact it needs -- head sha, repository, the
 * open PRs the completion belongs to -- arrives in the webhook payload itself,
 * and the prior-verdict lookup reads the local dispatch store.

 * red again -- re-ran the reviewer against an unchanged head and could churn a
 * valid CHANGES_REQUESTED.
 *
 * The test is deliberately asymmetric between the two authorizing verdicts:
 *
 *  - `checks_pending` carries NO check names (the reviewer deferred before
 *    forming a finding, and its summary is the empty string). There is nothing
 *    to match against, so any PASSING completion is relevant -- that is exactly
 *    the event the deferral was waiting for. Requiring a name here would make
 *    the deferral case permanently unrecoverable.
 *
 *  - `changes_requested` DOES name its checks, in the finding text
 *    (`[major] checks/test (windows-latest): ...`). A completion is relevant
 *    only when the verdict's summary mentions that check's name. This is the
 *    fail-closed direction: an unrecognised name is treated as unrelated, so a
 *    stray green job cannot clear a real rejection.
 *
 *  - A SUITE-level unit (`workflow_run`, `check_suite`) is always relevant when
 *    it passed: a green suite means every job inside it passed, the named one
 *    included, which is strictly stronger than any single job's result. Its own
 *    name ("CI") will not match an individual job name, so this case has to be
 *    recognised by unit kind rather than by name.
 *
 * NO GITHUB READ. The spec's alternative -- "the required-context set for the
 * head is now fully green" -- would need a `checks.listForRef` call per
 * completion event, on a path that exists precisely because the shared per-user
 * rate budget is what collapsed the review on #776. The sweep, which already
 * spends one bounded GitHub read per candidate, is where a whole-suite check
 * belongs; see `allRelevantChecksGreen` there.
