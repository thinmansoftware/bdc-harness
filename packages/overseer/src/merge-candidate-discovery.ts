/**
 * PR-first merge candidate discovery (bdc-harness#758).
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS FIXES
 * ---------------------
 * Before this module the merge coordinator's candidate set came from exactly one
 * source: `listRunsForWatch()` in watch.ts, which reads
 * `remote_agent_workflow_runs` (see packages/core/src/db/overseer.ts
 * listRunsForOverseerWatch). A pull request could therefore only ever become a
 * merge candidate by being reachable BACKWARDS from a workflow run that
 *
 *   1. is still in a terminal-but-unclosed state
 *      (`status IN ('completed','failed','escalated','cancelled')`), AND
 *   2. has no terminal `overseer_actions` row -- 'merged', 'watch_closed',
 *      'escalate_with_evidence', 'escalation_denied', 'tier_refused',
 *      'comment_findings' all permanently remove the run from the query, AND
 *   3. still carries recoverable owner/repo identity, AND
 *   4. survives the oldest-first `maxRunsPerTick` slice (default 25).
 *
 * A PR that fails ANY of those -- authored by hand, authored by a lane whose run
 * was long since closed with `watch_closed`, or simply older than the window --
 * is structurally invisible to the coordinator. It is not rejected; it is never
 * looked at. That is why 32 open PRs produced `"total":2,"eligible":0` on 19
 * consecutive heartbeats on 2026-09-04, and why #730 and #731 sat APPROVED and
 * CLEAN with every required check green and never merged: their runs were
 * already closed, so no amount of PR-side greenness could put them back in the
 * set. (`total` in that heartbeat was `runs.length` -- the RUN count -- which is
 * also why the number looked absurd next to the open-PR count.)
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DOES
 * ---------------------
 * Discovers candidates from the OTHER direction: it asks GitHub for the open
 * pull requests against the watched base branches and evaluates every one of
 * them. A PR that is open, not a draft, targets a watched base, has an APPROVED
 * review decision, has all required checks SUCCESS, and is mergeable/CLEAN
 * becomes a candidate. Every PR that is looked at and NOT included gets a
 * specific, named exclusion reason -- never silence.
 *
 * WHAT THIS MODULE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO
 * -----------------------------------------
 * It does not change merge AUTHORIZATION. Discovery is upstream of authority.
 * Everything downstream still runs unchanged for every candidate this module
 * produces: the M-48 merge enablement flags (MERGE_MANAGER_MUTATIONS_ENABLED,
 * OVERSEER_MERGE_MANAGER_MODE), the production-effect hold for John, the
 * provenance gate, the Review Gate exact-head approval precondition, the
 * allowed-bases check and the Grok second-opinion judge. This module only
 * decides which PRs get LOOKED AT. Whether any of them may actually merge is
 * still the Merge Manager's call, on exactly the rules it had before.

 * THE DEFECT THIS CLOSES (Overseer review of d62d6dd5, [major])
 * ------------------------------------------------------------
 * `findPullRequest` is addressed by head BRANCH and WO id, neither of which is
 * a unique key. Two open PRs can carry the same `headRef` (a fork and the
 * upstream, or two forks, all pushing `fix/thing`), and one WO id routinely
 * spans several PRs. The lookup therefore returns *a* pull request, not
 * necessarily *this* one -- and the caller was accepting it unconditionally.
 * The result is the worst possible shape of wrong: PR A's listing (its title,
 * its APPROVED review decision) fused to PR B's evidence (B's green checks, B's
 * clean mergeable state), emitted as one `merge_ready` record whose downstream
 * merge targets whichever number the record carries. An approval on one PR
 * would authorize a merge of another.
 *
 * The bind is on BOTH coordinates and both are required:
 *
 *  - `evidence.pr.number` must equal `pr.prNumber`. This is the identity check.
 *    A missing `pr` ref cannot be waved through: absent identity is unverified
 *    identity, and the whole point is to stop accepting unverified identity.
 *  - `evidence.headSha` must equal `pr.headSha`. This is the freshness check.
 *    Even for the right PR, evidence read after a push describes a DIFFERENT
 *    commit than the one whose review decision we classified. Admitting it
 *    would approve code no one reviewed -- the same stale-head hole the Review
 *    Gate closes downstream with `commitId === headSha`, closed here too so a
 *    candidate is never built on a moved head in the first place.
 *
 * Fails CLOSED in every uncertain direction: a mismatch, an absent `pr` ref and
 * an absent `headSha` all exclude. Excluding a good PR costs one tick (the
 * sweep is idempotent and re-evaluates next cycle); admitting a mis-bound one
 * merges the wrong code.
