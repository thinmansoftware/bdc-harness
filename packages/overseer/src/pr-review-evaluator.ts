/**
 * CHECKS_UNAVAILABLE (#775) is TERMINAL and NON-APPROVING: the required
 * status-check contexts could not be read after the configured attempt bound,
 * so no verdict can be formed and deferring further would park the PR forever.
 * It is distinct from CHECKS_PENDING (retry later) and from REQUEST_CHANGES
 * (a real code finding) -- nothing was found wrong with the code; the reviewer
 * simply could not see what CI is mandatory.
 *
 * TRANSPORT_ERROR is NON-TERMINAL and NON-JUDGING: the judge process could not
 * be reached at all (argument-list-too-long, spawn failure, timeout), so no
 * evidence was ever read by a model and no verdict formed. It is distinct from
 * INDETERMINATE (terminal -- the model looked and could not decide) and from
 * CHECKS_PENDING (CI still running).
 *
 * The distinction IS the bug this fixes. Passing the whole prompt as one argv
 * element hit Linux MAX_ARG_STRLEN (131,072 bytes per argument) on any PR whose
 * diff exceeded roughly 128 KB; Bun.spawn raised E2BIG, both ladder binaries
 * failed identically, and `indeterminate()` was returned -- a TERMINAL
 * non-approving verdict posted as CHANGES_REQUESTED with no stated reason.
 * Observed live 2026-09-07 on bdc-harness #776 (139,527-byte diff) and #786
 * (140,491), three times each. A transport failure says nothing about the code,
 * so it defers and retries instead of blocking the PR.
 *
 * RATE_LIMITED (#782 part 2) is NON-TERMINAL and NON-JUDGING: the GitHub client
 * exhausted its rate budget mid-review, so no evidence could be read and no
 * verdict formed. It is distinct from INDETERMINATE (terminal -- the reviewer
 * looked and could not decide), from TRANSPORT_ERROR (the judge process itself
 * was unreachable) and from CHECKS_PENDING (CI is still running).
 *
 * The distinction is the bug: a rate limit used to fall into the generic
 * evidence-error branch and become INDETERMINATE, a TERMINAL non-approving
 * verdict that retired the review and left the PR's stale verdict standing
 * forever. Observed live 2026-09-07 on bdc-harness #776 @c3935e09 (two
 * INDETERMINATE verdicts, the second during a per-user rate-limit exhaustion).
 * A rate limit is "come back at T", so it carries a retry instant and the work
 * item re-enters the queue then.
