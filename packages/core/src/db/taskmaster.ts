 * is immaterial -- idempotency is the whole point. For an external caller it is
 * not: a session told it registered a 24-hour expectation, when in fact it
 * matched a key whose deadline passed yesterday, believes work is supervised
 * that is not. Creation is read from the INSERT's own RETURNING clause, never
 * from a SELECT taken before it, so two simultaneous first-time callers cannot
 * both be told they created the row.
 *
 * THE CAP IS A PREDICATE INSIDE THE INSERT, NOT A CHECK BEFORE IT.
 *
 * Counting rows and then inserting -- even with the count inside a transaction
 * -- leaves a window under SQLite's default deferred locking: two writers can
 * both take read locks, both observe a count below the cap, and both then
 * insert, so the bound is exceeded by however many callers raced. That is a real
 * hole in a bound whose whole job is to stop a runaway buying unbounded future
 * escalations, and it is the kind of near-miss this registry exists to prevent
 * rather than reproduce.
 *
 * So the count is evaluated by the database as part of the same statement that
 * writes: `INSERT ... SELECT ... WHERE (SELECT COUNT(*) ...) < cap`. On SQLite
 * that is the whole answer -- one writer at a time, so the subquery cannot
 * observe a state another writer is midway through changing.
 *
 * On PostgreSQL it is NOT, and atomic must not be confused with serializable:
 * under READ COMMITTED each statement takes its own snapshot, so concurrent
 * transactions with DISTINCT keys can each count the same below-cap total and
 * each insert. The capped path therefore also takes a FOR UPDATE row lock on
 * the tm_control singleton under Postgres, which orders the counts. See the
 * comment at the insert for why that instrument and not SERIALIZABLE.
 *
 * A retry under an EXISTING key is admitted by the same statement even at the
 * cap. The predicate explicitly admits an existing registration_key so it can
 * reach ON CONFLICT; a genuinely new key must still have cap headroom. This is
 * deliberately not decided by a pre-insert probe, which would race another
 * request creating the same key.
