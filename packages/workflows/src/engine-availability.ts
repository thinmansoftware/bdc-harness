/**
 * engine-availability.ts -- runtime engine-dark tracking for router-dispatcher.
 * M-20260726-87-model-roster-indirection-and-opus-5-sweep (Cause 1).
 *
 * The bug this closes: `UNREACHABLE_ENGINES` in router-dispatcher.ts is a
 * hardcoded, compile-time, one-member set (LAN-topology only). Nothing marks
 * an engine unavailable at runtime, so when Fable ran out of subscription
 * quota the week of 2026-07-26, the router never learned to route around it
 * -- six runs, zero code (event store: 38 `node_failed` events carrying
 * "SDK returned success", 2026-07-26).
 *
 * BINDING DETECTION RULE (do not deviate; amended post-vote by the GPT seat's
 * ABSTAIN, see the motion's Ruling section): an engine is marked dark ONLY on
 * the token signature `tokens.input == 0 AND tokens.output == 0 AND cost ==
 * 0`. NEVER on the error string `SDK returned success` -- that string covers
 * at least three distinct failure classes (quota wall, pre-call infra
 * failure, SDK success-contradiction with a truncated-but-nonzero response).
 * Of the 38 production `SDK returned success` failures queried against the
 * event store, 4 had tokens flowing -- including one `sonnet` event
 * (input:6254, output:2) that under a loose error-string rule would have
 * marked Sonnet dark across every lane and taken out the workhorse tier. The
 * token-signature rule is strictly narrower and is what the board carried.
 *
 * This module intentionally does NOT touch `hasPositiveUsage` /
 * `classifyResourceExhaustedSdkResult` in dag-executor.ts. That existing code
 * answers a different question -- "should we start a long resource-exhausted
 * wait based on explicit quota text in the SDK error fields" -- and
 * deliberately refuses to treat zero-token-alone as evidence for that
 * decision (a bounded SDK-contradiction retry must not become an hours-long
 * wait). This module answers a narrower, separate question -- "should the
 * NEXT dispatch route around this engine" -- fed by the same telemetry but
 * consumed by a different caller (resolveEntryLane's ladder walk and the
 * explicit-fire refusal check). The two mechanisms coexist without
 * conflicting: a zero-token SDK-contradiction still gets its one bounded
 * node retry AND marks the engine dark for future dispatch decisions.
 *
 * SCOPE: marking is per-ENGINE (the router.yaml engine key, e.g.
 * `fable-session`), never per-node and never per-lane. A lane mixes models
 * (e.g. the fable lane's review nodes may run other providers); darkening
 * the lane would take out healthy seats. The router.yaml tier ladder is
 * already engine-keyed, so per-engine is the natural unit for
 * resolveEntryLane's ladder walk.
 *
 * EXPIRY: every mark carries a mandatory cooling-off window and auto-expires
 * -- a permanently-poisoned engine is a worse failure than the one being
 * fixed. See DEFAULT_COOLDOWN_MS for the chosen window and its
 * justification.
 *
 * PERSISTENCE: the in-memory set is the fast path consulted by the pure,
 * synchronous `resolveEntryLane` ladder walk (router-dispatcher.ts keeps its
 * "no provider/model call in the resolve path" contract -- this module has
 * zero DB/store dependency itself). Callers that DO have a WorkflowDeps.store
 * (dag-executor.ts, executor.ts) are responsible for also persisting a
 * `node_failed`-adjacent event when they call markEngineDarkIfZeroUsage /
 * markEngineDark, via recordAvailabilityEvent's returned event payload --
 * this keeps the module store-free while still making every mark/expiry
 * reconstructable from the event store, tagged to the workflow_run_id that
 * triggered it.

/**
 * Default cooling-off window: 20 minutes.
 *
 * Justification (per the motion's open requirement -- propose a number from
 * observed quota-reset behavior, board left deliberately unset):
 *
 * - Subscription quota walls (the proven failure: Fable ran dry mid-week) do
 *   not reliably reset on a short cycle -- rolling multi-hour/day windows are
 *   typical for flat-rate subscription products. A short TTL (5 min) would
 *   thrash: re-probe the same exhausted window repeatedly, burning the exact
 *   one-node-per-attempt cost this mechanism exists to bound, for no benefit.
 * - A window long enough to matter for subscription exhaustion (hours) risks
 *   the "permanently poisoned engine" failure mode when the real cause was
 *   transient (a single pre-call infra hiccup that happened to log
 *   zero-token, not a real wall) -- 38 zero-token-adjacent events were
 *   observed in ONE week, so false positives are not rare enough to justify
 *   an hours-long sticky mark.
 * - 20 minutes is chosen as a middle ground: long enough that a real quota
 *   wall does not get re-hit by the very next dispatch (avoids the
 *   thrash/burn-one-node-repeatedly failure), short enough that a
 *   misattributed transient mark self-heals within one work session rather
 *   than silently routing around a healthy engine for the rest of the day.
 * - This is a starting number, not a tuned one -- no historical quota-reset
 *   telemetry exists yet to fit it against (Grok's design-round review could
 *   not verify the production event-store stats locally either). Revisit
 *   once real mark/expiry/re-mark events accumulate in the event store this
 *   mechanism now writes.
