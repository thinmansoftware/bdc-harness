/**
 * Taskmaster Slice 1 rules (WO-HARNESS-TASKMASTER-SLICE1-01, M-133).
 *
 * Pure functions only: thread classification and next-action computation.
 * No I/O, no clock reads -- the caller injects `now`.
 *
 * Nudge clocks per the ratified Q1 numbers: 30min P0/customer, 4h P1,
 * 24h P2-P3. Exceptions (undelivered ratified rulings, unclaimed P0s) act
 * on the tick that confirms eligibility; ordinary nudges require the same
 * proposal to be eligible on TWO consecutive ticks before acting.
 *
 * NOTE (Rule 17): the WO spec cites duty_officer.ts as the source of the
 * idle/stale math, but the live file contains transport + content-guard code
 * only -- no staleness classification exists there to port. The math here is
 * implemented directly from spec Section 8's ratified nudge clocks.
 *
 * M-155 WO 3 (WO-HARNESS-TASKMASTER-EXCEPTION-PUSH-01): ordinary nudges are
 * composed from the tm_adoption projection (title, owner, blocker, next
 * action) and are content-gated -- bare staleness with no known next action
 * no longer sends. deliver_ruling and escalate_p0 are content-EXEMPT
 * (governance facts, not item state) and still fire without an adoption row.
 * Threads whose two most recent graded sends were both 'noise' are suppressed
 * until their adoption content hash changes (durable state in tm_suppression).
