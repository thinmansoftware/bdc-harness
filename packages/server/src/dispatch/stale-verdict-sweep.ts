/**
 * Stale-verdict sweep (bdc-harness #782 part 3).
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES: the webhook path (part 1) only fires when GitHub
 * actually delivers a `check_run`/`workflow_run` completion. Deliveries are
 * lost -- the container restarts mid-flight, the App's event subscription is
 * added after a job already finished, a delivery 500s and GitHub gives up. When
 * that happens the PR is right back in the state John named on 2026-09-07: a
 * standing CHANGES_REQUESTED at a head whose check has since gone green, and
 * nothing to clear it but a human nudge.
 *
 * The sweep is the backstop, not the primary path. On each review-worker
 * heartbeat it looks at open candidate PRs whose latest verdict predates the
 * latest check completion AT THE SAME HEAD, and enqueues exactly one re-review
 * each -- reusing the SAME idempotency rule as the webhook path, so a sweep and
 * a delivery that both notice the same completion produce one row, not two.
 *
 * BOUNDED BY DESIGN. `OVERSEER_STALE_VERDICT_SWEEP_MAX` (default 3) is a budget
 * of CANDIDATES TOUCHED per heartbeat, not of re-reviews enqueued. The bound
 * exists because this is the only part of #782 that costs GitHub API budget:
 * deciding whether a verdict is stale requires reading the check runs at that
 * head, and the shared per-user budget is what collapsed a review on #776 in
 * the first place. An unbounded sweep across every open PR every minute would
 * reintroduce exactly the exhaustion this WO is also fixing.
 *
 * Counting enqueues instead would not bound anything that matters: a heartbeat
 * where every candidate is authorized but not yet stale, or already enqueued by
 * the webhook, produces zero enqueues while still issuing one GitHub read per
 * candidate. So the budget is spent when a candidate is PICKED UP, before its
 * outcome is known, and the single refund is the local-only unsweepable check
 * that issues no read at all.

 * `run_review` rows already have unparseable or incomplete bodies. The discard
 * path is exercised in production today.
 *
 * So the page reports both:
 *  - `lastRawSeq`: the position of the last RAW row the query returned, whether
 *    or not it parsed. This is what the cursor advances to, so discarded rows
 *    are walked PAST rather than re-read every heartbeat.

 * in the fetched page. With a fixed window, a run of ineligible candidates
 * exhausted the page with the budget unspent, and every later heartbeat
 * re-fetched the identical rows.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A KEYSET AND PERSISTED (second Overseer finding, @45aa739e): the
 * first fix used an in-memory array index against a page that `listMessages`
 * hard-caps at 500 rows, applying the offset only AFTER that page was fetched.
 * The live store holds ~4,900 dispatch rows, so the walk could never see past
 * the first page: once the index passed the candidates inside it, the sweep
 * rewound. And a process-local cursor rewinds on every archon-app-1 rebuild
 * anyway. So the resume token is now the database-assigned `seq` of the last
 * row consumed, pushed into the query itself and persisted across restarts --
 * each page is a genuinely different slice of the store.
 *
