# Overseer v2 Control Surfaces (M-94 record)

Shipped with WO-HARNESS-OVERSEER-V2-JUDGE-FIRST-01 per Motion M-99 binding term 8:
every remaining switch, its default, its writer, and the condition under which it
opens. Nothing on this list is flipped autonomously, ever.

| Surface | Kind | Default | Open condition |
|---|---|---|---|
| `OVERSEER_ENABLED` | env (master enable) | off | Container env on archon-app-1. Master switch for the whole service. |
| `OVERSEER_JUDGE_FIRST` | env (feature flag) | off (`0`) | Flip is a deploy decision announced on bdc-xo#1315 after this WO merges and the container is rebuilt. Flag off = v1 classifier path, byte-identical. |
| `OVERSEER_EMERGENCY_STOP` | env (emergency stop) | off | Human-set only. Halts ALL record handling (judging AND actions) while the watch loop stays alive; recovery is unsetting the var. |
| `OVERSEER_DRY_RUN` | env | off | Suppresses external mutations (steward handoff, PR comments) on both paths. Verdict rows, receipts, and escalation cards still write -- thinking and audit are never gated. |
| `OVERSEER_JUDGE_LADDER` | env (config) | `grok` | Comma-separated judge binaries, cheapest first (each invoked as `<bin> -p <prompt>`). Change = ops decision, announce on #1315. |
| `OVERSEER_USE_FAKE_GITHUB_ADAPTER` | env (legacy) | off (real) | Test/dev only. Fake adapter cannot reach GitHub. |
| `overseer_capability_state.merge.action_enabled` | DB row | `0` (writer `migration-034`) | JOHN ONLY, on the Arc B evidence package ((a)+(b) proven separately). The judge-first path never reads or writes it; the steward path keeps all its guards. |
| `overseer_capability_state.{escalation,repair,branch,lifecycle}` | DB rows | per migration-034 | Legacy v1 capability rows. Preserved read-only for history; the judge-first path does not consult them. Tier >= 1 execution tickets are a later M-99 slice. |
| M-31 permit tables (`overseer_m31_*`) | DB tables | append-only | DEAD as a gate (scope ruling 2026-07-28 on #1315). Preserved read-only for history. The permit primitive returns only as a short-lived execution ticket for Tier >= 1 mutations in a later slice. |

## Authority model (one law)

M-15 tiers, implemented in `packages/overseer/src/tier-map.ts`:

- The verdict PROPOSES a tier; code independently maps the action's REQUIRED
  tier; the STRICTER wins. Unknown action kinds fail closed to the maximum tier.
- Tiers gate EXECUTION only. Consultation (judging, verdict rows) is never gated.
- v1-of-v2 executes exactly four Tier 0 actions: `verdict_write`,
  `comment_findings`, `flag_merge_ready`, `escalate_with_evidence`. Everything
  above Tier 0 records a `tier_refused` receipt.

## Judge health (fail-loud)

`judge_unavailable`, `judge_invalid_output`, and `evidence_unavailable` are
operational alarm states on the verdict row -- never semantic verdicts. Each is
retryable up to 3 times via the model ladder; exhaustion escalates with evidence
to the operator card rail. The legacy fail-closed collapse in
`judge-second-opinion.ts` survives ONLY on the merge-steward path, where
fail-closed remains correct.

## Idempotency

One primary verdict per `(run_id, head_sha)` (unique index, claim-before-call in
`claimOverseerVerdict`). Replay never re-bills a model call and never re-acts.
