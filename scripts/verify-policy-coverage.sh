# Audits whether every registered Cauldron codebase resolves the canonical
# Universal Agent Behavior Policy declared by workflow YAMLs as:
#   policyFile: harness/policies/agent-behavior.md
#
# Resolution rules (must match executor.ts applyWorkflowPolicyFile):
#   1. Local copy at <repo>/harness/policies/agent-behavior.md (preferred)
#   2. Bundled canonical via this repo's BUNDLED_POLICIES (Approach B)
#
# A repo reports:
#   RESOLVED via local   -- file exists at the canonical path on `main`
#   RESOLVED via bundled -- local file absent; fallback resolves from this repo
#   UNRESOLVED -- neither source resolves (FAIL)
#
# Exits 0 if every repo is RESOLVED. Exits 1 otherwise.
#
# Requires `gh` CLI authenticated for the bluedevilcollectibles org.
