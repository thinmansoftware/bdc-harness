# Taskmaster (Slice 1) -- Operator Runbook

WO: WO-HARNESS-TASKMASTER-SLICE1-01 | Authority: M-133 (CARRIED 3-0, John 2026-08-06)

The Taskmaster is an always-on deterministic loop inside the bdc-harness
server (archon-app-1, Hetzner 5.78.86.90). Every tick (default 60s) it:

1. Delivers undelivered ratified rulings (queued board-motion mailbox rows
   with no acknowledgement) to their seat.
2. Nudges idle threads past their clock: 30min P0/customer, 4h P1, 24h P2-P3.
3. Escalates unclaimed P0s to John (via the `operator` dispatch drain).
4. Sends one daily digest summarizing its journal.

All effects are dispatch messages through the existing dispatch DAL
(`agent_dispatch_messages`). It has NO spend, send-to-customer, deploy,
merge, assignment, or WO-authoring authority (Slice 1 exclusions, ratified).

## Fire source binding (PR746 source candidate, not activated)

This subsection documents `WO-HARNESS-TASKMASTER-FIRE-ALL-PRIORITIES-01`
source behavior. It does not certify deployment or authorize enabling fire.
The older Slice 1 and P0-only descriptions elsewhere on this page are
historical context, not evidence that this candidate is running.

Eligible, unclaimed P0-P3 work can produce a fire proposal. Priority determines
fire order, not permission. The fire cap is three per tick within the existing
ten-effect cap; overflow remains deferred. Assigned, claimed, blocked, or held
work cannot fire. Existing pause, backoff, and lane-budget checks still apply.
Hold labels exclude fire without changing ordinary nudge classification.

### Canonical source and trust boundary

Eligibility reuses `freezeWorkOrderSource`, resolving bdc-xo `main` to an
immutable commit before reading these exact paths in order:

1. `docs/work-orders/<WO_ID>.md`
2. `docs/superpowers/specs/<WO_ID>.md`

There is no date-glob or issue-title-search fallback for Taskmaster fires.
Issue-only specs fail closed: issue-authored `cauldron_compatible: true` and
`target_repo` fields are not an execution grant. This follows the permitted
safety alternative recorded on bdc-xo issue1843 and replaces the older WO
scenario expecting issue-only automatic eligibility. The current feature
lanes consume frozen authority artifacts, not their historical dead resolver.

Eligibility records `expectedSpec` with the full canonical source, commit
revision, and SHA-256 content hash. The legacy `specSource: repo-path` category
covers either exact committed path; `expectedSpec.specSource` distinguishes
them. Both the loop and direct proposal function require the identity to fire.
The cascade carries it through retries. Runtime resolves its own authority
policy and rejects a mismatch before worker creation or isolation.
Prior-attempt prose cannot supply or replace the binding.

Premium approval packets preserve the same constraint on resume. Original
Taskmaster packets identified by `tm:fire:` without a binding are refused.
Existing identity-less manual packets remain compatible; historical UUID
descendants do not establish Taskmaster provenance.

### Diagnose a blocked fire

- `spec_missing`: verify a spec exists at one of the two committed paths,
  rather than only in an issue body.
- `authority_conflict`: compare journal `fireEvidence.expectedSpec` with the
  canonical source and, when available, the run's authority manifest. A changed
  source, revision, or hash requires fresh eligibility and governed re-dispatch.
  Strict revision equality intentionally also refuses an unchanged spec after
  an unrelated bdc-xo main commit, including a delayed premium resume. Do not
  strip the binding to recover. This liveness tradeoff remains an activation
  decision; this source repair does not relax the same-revision/hash contract.
- A legacy Taskmaster approval packet missing its identity needs fresh
  eligibility and governed re-dispatch, not fabricated approval metadata.

Local verification from the bdc-harness checkout:

```powershell
bun test packages/server/src/taskmaster/
bun test packages/core/src/workflows/work-order-source.test.ts
bun test packages/smart-cauldron/src/__tests__/fire.test.ts
bun test packages/smart-cauldron/src/__tests__/cascade.test.ts
bun test packages/smart-cauldron/src/__tests__/frontier-approval-resume.test.ts
bun run validate
```

These commands do not deploy, unpause Taskmaster, enable firing, or satisfy
the WO's runtime stop condition. Source review and runtime acceptance are
separate gates. A supplied `healthy` classification does not suppress an
undelivered ruling; normal classification already marks that ruling ready.
This preserves the existing governance-delivery behavior.

## Environment

| Variable                       | Meaning                                                                                                             |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `TASKMASTER_INTERVAL_MS`       | Tick interval. `60000` in production compose. `0` = KILLED (loop off, zero effects) -- this is the rollback switch. |
| `TASKMASTER_GH_REPOS`          | Comma-separated GitHub repos read as the work SOR (default `bluedevilcollectibles/bdc-xo`).                         |
| `TASKMASTER_USAGE_ARTIFACT`    | Optional path to a local usage-anchor JSON (`{"tokensRemaining": N, "observedAt": ISO}`).                           |
| `TASKMASTER_CLI_ANCHOR_CMD`    | Optional shell probe printing tokens-remaining; failure reads as UNKNOWN, never 0.                                  |
| `TASKMASTER_FIRE_VERB_ENABLED` | Enables mechanically-qualified unclaimed-P0 Cauldron fires. Default `false`; leave off through deploy.              |
| `TASKMASTER_FIRE_MAX_PER_DAY`  | Maximum successful automatic fires per UTC day. Default `2`.                                                        |

### Enable the fire verb

After the updated container and migration are verified, John can set
`TASKMASTER_FIRE_VERB_ENABLED=true` and optionally tune
`TASKMASTER_FIRE_MAX_PER_DAY`, then force-recreate the container so its env file
is re-read. Observe the first fires in `tm_journal`; every `fire_cauldron` sent
row must contain a `cascadeId`/`runId` in `proposal_json`. Set the enable flag
back to `false` and force-recreate to stop new fire proposals. The normal
Taskmaster pause with `pause_scope='effects'` also parks every fire effect.

## Status

```bash
curl -s -H "x-archon-operator-token: $ARCHON_OPERATOR_TOKEN" \
  http://localhost:3090/api/taskmaster/status
```

Returns `pause_state` (RUNNING | PAUSED | HARD_PAUSE), `epoch`,
`tick_health` (healthy | degraded | not_running), `interval_ms`,
`last_tick_at`, `headroom_state` (OK | LOW | UNKNOWN), `effects_last_24h`.

`last_tick_at` is the last successfully completed tick, not merely the last
attempt. A failed startup or failed tick therefore cannot report a false-green
heartbeat. `tick_health` flips to `degraded` after 3 missed intervals; the EXTERNAL
dead-man checker in the Overseer package
(`packages/overseer/src/taskmaster-deadman-check.ts`) escalates exactly once
per degradation episode and re-arms on recovery.

GitHub work discovery accepts the `wo`, `project`, or `arc` label. Priorities
may be written as `P0` through `P3`, `prio:P0` through `prio:P3`, or
`priority:P0` through `priority:P3` (case-insensitive). `blocked` and
`status:blocked` are blocked states; `status:building` and `status:review` are
active states and prevent an item from being treated as an unclaimed P0.

When a nudge causes progress, record that evidence on the source GitHub issue
with an exact first-line marker of `[PROGRESS]` or `[BLOCKED]`. Taskmaster ignores
its own outbound dispatch row as proof of progress.

### Action grades (M-155 Amendment 03)

| Grade     | Meaning                                                                                                                                                    | Useful-rate floor         |
| --------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `useful`  | A non-draining recipient acknowledged the dispatch and the external source of record shows qualifying downstream movement.                                 | Numerator and denominator |
| `noise`   | A non-draining recipient acknowledged the dispatch, but qualifying movement was absent at the proof deadline.                                              | Denominator               |
| `unheard` | The dispatch was not acknowledged, or its recipient uses `drain_on_start`; acknowledgement from an auto-draining mailbox is not evidence a human heard it. | Excluded                  |

John's 2026-09-21 ruling in M-155 Amendment 03 requires `unheard` to be
queryable in `tm_journal.grade` and excluded from the usefulness floor. Resume
after a floor pause remains an operator decision.

## Pause (John or operator)

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "x-archon-operator-token: $ARCHON_OPERATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"reason":"why","actor":"john"}' \
  http://localhost:3090/api/taskmaster/pause
```

Paused mode stops ordinary sends but NEVER stops watching: monitoring, P0
escalation, and the digest stay alive. Parked proposals are journaled with
`outcome='parked'`. An automatic circuit (forbidden/duplicate/unlogged
effect) HARD-PAUSES effects on its own; it can only tighten into pause,
never convert into KILL.

## Resume (John-authorized)

```bash
curl -s -X POST -H "x-archon-operator-token: $ARCHON_OPERATOR_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"actor":"john"}' \
  http://localhost:3090/api/taskmaster/resume
```

Resume increments the pause epoch only when leaving PAUSED or HARD_PAUSE.
Every successful invocation EXPIRES stale parked/pending proposals rather
than replaying them and writes its own audit (response includes
`expired_proposals` and `audit_id`). An already-RUNNING reset preserves the
epoch-start timestamp, so accumulated useful/noise grades remain in scope.

## Journal queries (on archon-app-1)

Activation-proof query (SC7 kill test -- binding condition 4):

```bash
sqlite3 /opt/bdc/archon-data/archon.db \
  "SELECT count(*) FROM tm_journal WHERE outcome='sent' AND grade='useful' AND action_type <> 'digest'"
```

This count is necessary but not sufficient for SC7. Each qualifying row must
also be correlated to action-specific evidence in the source SOR after the send:
a delivered ruling was addressed by its recipient, a nudge produced a source
issue close or marker, or a P0 escalation produced a close, assignee, active
status, or marker. A `fire_cauldron` row qualifies when its admitted run
completes/opens a PR or the source issue gains `status:building` before the
deadline. Digests never qualify as useful SC7 actions.

Recent automatic fires:

```bash
sqlite3 /opt/bdc/archon-data/archon.db \
  "SELECT id, created_at, outcome, grade, proposal_json FROM tm_journal WHERE action_type='fire_cauldron' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 5"
```

Recent actions:

```bash
sqlite3 /opt/bdc/archon-data/archon.db \
  "SELECT created_at, action_type, thread_ref, outcome, grade FROM tm_journal ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20"
```

Pause state:

```bash
sqlite3 /opt/bdc/archon-data/archon.db "SELECT * FROM tm_control WHERE id=1"
```

## Registering an expectation

Use the authenticated front door instead of writing `tm_expectations` directly.
From the bdc-harness checkout, register a 24-hour PR expectation with:

```powershell
scripts/taskmaster/expect.ps1 -Ref bdc-xo#2006 -Recipient fable-cursor `
  -Evidence pr_opened:thinmansoftware/fuelglass -DueIn 24h -OnAbsence escalate
```

The script calls `POST /api/taskmaster/expectations` with the operator token.
Reuse the same registration key when retrying: the first request returns a new
expectation and later requests return that stored expectation without consuming
daily-cap headroom. See
`docs/doctrine/taskmaster-expectation-registration.md` for the API contract and
evidence forms.

## Known issues

WO-HARNESS-TM-HEALTH-UPSERT-CONFLICT-FIX-01 repairs legacy on-disk `tm_health`
tables whose composite `PRIMARY KEY (provider, sampled_at)` made every
provider health upsert fail. On connection, `migrateColumns()` preserves
the table and its schema objects, retains the latest sample per provider,
and adds a provider-only unique index using an unoccupied schema name.
An existing compatible unique index makes the repair a no-op. This allows
`/api/taskmaster/status` headroom to reflect recorded spawn evidence after
the separately governed runtime rollout.

## Kill / rollback

Set `TASKMASTER_INTERVAL_MS=0` in compose and restart the container. The
loop never starts, zero effects occur, monitoring endpoints still answer
(`tick_health=not_running`). All Slice 1 migrations are additive; no
existing table was altered.

## Budgets (ratified Q1)

- Max 10 effects per tick; overflow journaled `deferred`, not dropped.
- Max 1 effect per item per tick.
- Max 3 automated interventions per item per 24h.
- Ordinary nudges require eligibility on two consecutive ticks; undelivered
  rulings and unclaimed P0s act on the confirming tick.
- Each logical effect has one journal row. A failed or deferred attempt reuses
  that row on the next eligible tick; retries are bounded by the original
  deadline, and expired rows are terminal.
